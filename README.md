A Basic E-commerce website that was built using ReactJS front-end library.

This a simple clothing site that allows the user to browse through the inventory adding the products they want to the their shopping cart. When the user is ready they can navigate to the check and simulate checking out. The app currently contains the incentory of the shop locally and the payment process is incomplete. I intend to implement a back-end for the incentory and implemt a payment processor for checkout.
